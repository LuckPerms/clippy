In case your server has been infected by such malware:\n 1. Stop the server\n 2. Delete all plugins in your plugins folder, and just to be safe also the server jar file\n 3. Re-Download all plugins and server jar files **from official websites** such as SpigotMC or official plugin websites ( luckperms.net for example ).\n 4.
